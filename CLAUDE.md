# Kana Match Master - Project Documentation

## Overview
Kana Match Master is an educational match-3 puzzle game designed to teach Japanese hiragana and katakana characters alongside their romaji (romanized) equivalents. The game requires players to match sets of three characters representing the same sound across different writing systems.

## Game Mechanics

### Core Gameplay
- **Grid**: 6x6 board containing hiragana, katakana, and romaji characters
- **Matching Rule**: Players must select exactly 3 tiles that:
  - Represent the same sound (e.g., あ, ア, a)
  - Are from different writing systems (one hiragana, one katakana, one romaji)
- **Visual Feedback**: When a tile is selected, all other tiles of the same type fade to 30% opacity
- **Completion**: Matched tiles disappear, leaving empty spaces on the board

### Visual Design
- **Hiragana**: Pink background (#FFB6C1) with darker pink border (#FF69B4)
- **Katakana**: Blue background (#87CEEB) with darker blue border (#4682B4)
- **Romaji**: Green background (#90EE90) with darker green border (#32CD32)
- **Typography**: Noto Sans JP font for proper Japanese character rendering

### Key Features
1. **Smart Selection System**: Prevents selecting multiple tiles of the same type
2. **Visual Guidance**: Faded tiles indicate which types cannot be selected
3. **Progress Tracking**: Shows matches completed and current level
4. **Hint System**: Highlights a valid match set when clicked
5. **Dynamic Instructions**: Text updates to show which tile types are still needed

## Technical Implementation

### State Management
- `board`: 6x6 array storing tile objects
- `selectedTiles`: Array of currently selected tile positions
- `score`: Points earned (100 per match)
- `matches`: Number of successful matches
- `level`: Current level (advances after 12 matches)

### Tile Object Structure
```javascript
{
    kana: { hiragana: 'あ', katakana: 'ア', romaji: 'a' },
    kanaIndex: 0,  // Index in the kana pool
    type: 'hiragana',  // 'hiragana', 'katakana', or 'romaji'
    display: 'あ'  // The character to display
}
```

### Key Functions
- `handleTileClick()`: Manages tile selection and type checking
- `updateFadedTiles()`: Applies fade effect to same-type tiles
- `checkMatch()`: Validates if selected tiles form a valid match
- `processMatch()`: Handles match animation and tile removal

## Educational Design

### Learning Objectives
1. **Character Recognition**: Learn to identify hiragana and katakana characters
2. **Sound Association**: Connect characters to their phonetic sounds
3. **Script Differentiation**: Understand the relationship between writing systems
4. **Active Learning**: Reinforcement through repetitive matching

### Progression System
- Starts with 12 kana families per level
- Each level introduces new characters
- Total of 20 basic kana implemented (can be expanded)

## Future Enhancements

### Suggested Improvements
1. **Audio Integration**: Add pronunciation audio for each character
2. **Practice Mode**: Show all three forms together for study
3. **Statistics Tracking**: Record accuracy and learning progress
4. **Mobile Optimization**: Touch-friendly interface for tablets
5. **Expanded Character Set**: Include dakuten/handakuten variations

### Potential Features
- Time-based challenges
- Multiplayer competition
- Spaced repetition algorithm
- Custom character sets
- Achievement system

## Development Notes

### Browser Compatibility
- Modern browsers with ES6 support required
- CSS Grid and Flexbox for layout
- No external dependencies (pure vanilla JavaScript)

### Performance Considerations
- Animations use CSS transforms for GPU acceleration
- Event delegation could improve click handling with many tiles
- Consider requestAnimationFrame for smoother animations

### Accessibility
- High contrast colors for visibility
- Large, readable fonts
- Clear visual feedback for all actions
- Could add keyboard navigation support

## File Structure
Single HTML file containing:
- Embedded CSS styles
- Inline JavaScript
- No external dependencies
- Self-contained and portable

This design creates an engaging educational experience that makes learning Japanese characters intuitive and enjoyable through game mechanics.
